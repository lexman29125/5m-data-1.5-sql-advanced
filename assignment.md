# Assignment

## Brief

Write the SQL statements for the following questions.

## Instructions

Paste the answer as SQL in the answer code section below each question.

### Question 1

Using the `claim` and `car` tables, write a SQL query to return a table containing `id, claim_date, travel_time, claim_amt` from `claim`, and `car_type, car_use` from `car`. Use an appropriate join based on the `car_id`.

Answer:

```sql
SELECT a.id, a.claim_date, a.travel_time, a.claim_amt, b.car_type, b.car_use
FROM claim a
INNER JOIN car b ON a.car_id =b.id;
```

### Question 2

Write a SQL query to compute the running total of the `travel_time` column for each `car_id` in the `claim` table. The resulting table should contain `id, car_id, travel_time, running_total`.

Answer:

```sql
SELECT id, car_id, travel_time,
SUM(travel_time) OVER (PARTITION BY car_id ORDER BY id) AS running_total
FROM claim;
```

### Question 3

Using a Common Table Expression (CTE), write a SQL query to return a table containing `id, resale_value, car_use` from `car`, where the car resale value is less than the average resale value for the car use.

Answer:

```sql
WITH avg_resale_by_use AS (
    SELECT
        car_use,
        AVG(resale_value) AS avg_resale
    FROM car
    GROUP BY car_use
)
SELECT
    c.id,
    c.resale_value,
    c.car_use
FROM car c
INNER JOIN avg_resale_by_use a ON c.car_use = a.car_use
WHERE c.resale_value < a.avg_resale;
```
